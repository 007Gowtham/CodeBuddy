# Backend Setup and Testing Guide

## Fixed Issues

✅ **JSON Parsing Error Fixed**: The "Expected ',' or '}' after property value in JSON at position 93" error has been resolved with improved JSON sanitization.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Enhanced JSON Sanitization**: Created a robust `jsonSanitizer.js` utility that properly handles:
   - Unescaped quotes in string values
   - Line breaks in JSON strings
   - Control characters
   - Trailing commas
   - Malformed JSON structures

2. **Improved Error Handling**: Updated `questionService.js` to:
   - Handle missing or malformed question data gracefully
   - Continue processing other topics if one fails
   - Provide detailed logging for debugging
   - Support both `examples` and `example` fields from AI responses

3. **Better Question Generation**: Enhanced `questiongeneration.js` to:
   - Use the new sanitization utility
   - Provide better error messages
   - Handle edge cases in AI responses

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/challenger_db"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/challenger_db"

# Gemini AI Configuration
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 2. Database Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# (Optional) Open Prisma Studio to view data
npx prisma studio
```

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
# Development mode with auto-restart
npm run dev

# Or production mode
npm start
```

## Testing Question Creation

### Method 1: Direct Service Test

```bash
node test-question-creation.js
```

This will:
- Check for existing rooms
- Create a test room with topics if none exist
- Generate questions for the room
- Display the created questions

### Method 2: API Endpoint Test

1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. In another terminal: `node test-api.js`

### Method 3: Manual API Testing

```bash
# Create questions for room ID 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/questions/1
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /questions/:roomId` - Generate questions for a room
- `GET /` - Health check

## Database Schema

The system uses the following main models:
- `Room` - Competition rooms
- `RoomTopic` - Topics for each room (e.g., "Dynamic Programming", "Arrays")
- `Question` - Generated questions
- `QuestionExample` - Sample inputs/outputs
- `TestCase` - Test cases for evaluation
- `Team` - Teams participating
- `Player` - Individual players
- `Answer` - Player submissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Room not found"**: Make sure the room ID exists in the database
2. **"No topics found"**: Ensure the room has associated topics
3. **"No questions generated"**: Check your GEMINI_API_KEY is valid
4. **Database connection errors**: Verify DATABASE_URL is correct

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting `NODE_ENV=development` in your `.env` file.

## File Structure

```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/     # API controllers
│   ├── service/         # Business logic
│   ├── models/          # Database models

└── test-*.js           # Test files
```

## Next Steps

1. Set up your environment variables
2. Run the database migrations
3. Test question creation with the provided scripts
4. Integrate with your frontend application

The JSON parsing issue has been completely resolved, and the system now handles malformed AI responses gracefully.
